# Ziggurat

This is the Ziggurat repo, containing code, tests and documentation for the Ziggurat publishing framework. To get started head over to the [user documentation](https://ziggurat.gitbook.io/).

## Introduction

Ziggurat is a lightweight open-source database written in typescript with the purpose of publishing content in a web application such as a blog or a larger web site. The framework is isomorphic, meaning it can run both on the server and the client.

## Philosophy

The framework was created mainly to make it easy to share content between a server and a client. It was built using a highly modular design with scalability in mind which means you could use it for a simple web-page, blog or larger web application.

When running it in a web-browser you probably want to have the content rendered using some front-end framework. Ziggurat does not limit your choices here.
