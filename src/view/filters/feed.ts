 * A filter that provides a feed.

 * This filter is suited for where a list of items are shown and the user has the ability
 * to load more. The feed will keep track of how many items should be displayed.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * The feed is configured by setting an initial limit and an increment by which the limit is
 * increased each time more items are requested.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class MyView {
 *   feed = new FeedFilter({
 *     limit: 10,
 *     increment: 5
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 * Provided that the collection has enough documents available the above feed will make sure that
 * the view has only 10 documents initially. Calling loadMore() will increase the capacity to 15.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * view.feed.loadMore()
 * ```
