/**
 * A filter that limits documents based on a selector object.
 *
 * A view can have multiple selector filters. Each filter will extend the selector object
 * produced by the previous ones.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * The simplest form of selector filter is one where the value is simply a selector object.
 * This is especially useful when we just want to create a static filter.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class MyView {
 *   selector = new SelectorFilter<object>({
 *     value: {category: 'cars'}
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The above view will limit documents to ones where category is equal to 'cars'.
 * Even though the value of the selector can be changed to show another category with this filter
 * there is a better way to do dynamic selectors. Below we create a filter where the selector is
 * instead compiled from a string value. By default the value is 'all' which means we want to show
 * all categories rather than a specific one. To achive this we can disable the filter for a
 * specific value by setting the 'disableOn' property.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class MyView {
 *   category = new SelectorFilter<string>({
 *     value: 'all',
 *     compile: value => ({category: value}),
 *     disableOn: 'all'
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Changing the category using the above filter is now trivial:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * view.category.value = 'bikes';
 * ```
