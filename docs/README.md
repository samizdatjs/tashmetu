# Introduction

## Description

Ziggurat is a lightweight open-source database written in typescript with the purpose of publishing content in a web application such as a blog or a larger web site. The framework is isomorphic, meaning it can run both on the server and the client.

Setting up an application is easy, so let's get started!

## Philosophy

The framework was created mainly to make it easy to share content between a server and a client. It was built using a highly modular design with scalability in mind which means you could use it for a simple web-page, blog or larger web application. 

When running it in a web-browser you probably want to have the content rendered using some front-end framework. Ziggurat does not limit your choices here.

## Components

The framework is split over a few main packages. This documentation covers the main one which is the database itself. The other packages are as follows

### [Tiamat](https://ziqquratu.gitbook.io/tiamat/)

The foundation library used for defining components and handling dependency injection.

### [Nabu](https://ziqquratu.gitbook.io/nabu/)

A set of tools for reading and writing content on disk. It allows us to store collections in files with support for common formats like JSON, YAML or Markdown. 

### [Tashmetu](https://ziqquratu.gitbook.io/tashmetu/)

An HTTP server for publishing content. It allows us to define RESTful resources that interact with the collections in our database.
